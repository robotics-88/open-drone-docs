# Open Drone Stack

!!! warning
    WORK IN PROGRESS (docs and code): For a ready-to-fly version, check back 8-1-25.

Welcome to the Open Drone Stack ‚Äî a modular, ROS2-based system for autonomous drones. The full stack includes not only the ROS code to provide drone autonomy, but also a basic frontend and drone<-->server connection. Follow the complete [Setup Guide](setup/index.md) to use our stack as is, or jump to [Development](development/index.md) to learn how to set custom missions and more for your application!

## Use Cases

This system is designed for versatility, from research labs to commercial deployments. Our goal is to make advanced autonomy accessible: even a novice roboticist should be able to go from a newly built drone to custom autonomous missions in under an hour (and by custom, we mean a little to a lot more than a basic lawnmower pattern).

### Example Missions

<div class="grid cards">

  <a class="card-link" href="system/missions/#goal-point">
    <div class="card-content">
      <span class="md-icon" style="font-size: 2rem;">üî•</span>
      <h3>Goal Point</h3>
      <p>This custom mission is the most basic: Navigate to a goal point dropped on the map.</p>

      <h3>Powerline Following</h3>
      <p>Uses LiDAR to identify and follow a powerline, producing a vegetation encroachment map.</p>

      <span class="md-icon" style="font-size: 2rem;">üõ†Ô∏è</span>
      <h3>Trail Following</h3>
      <p>This custom mission enables a new flight pattern in which the drone identifies and follows trails.</p>

    <div class="card-content">
      <span class="md-icon" style="font-size: 2rem;">üå≤</span>
      <h3>Smart Lawnmower</h3>
      <p>This custom mission uses our path manager's 'adaptive' lawnmower flight pattern, which adjusts waypoints based on user-defined decision criteria. E.g., add a new criteria to push the flight path toward species of interest.</p>

## Overview

The Open Drone Stack is composed of:

- A ROS 2-based flight stack
- A REST API server on drone
- A web-based frontend
- A set of modular ROS 2 packages
- Optional simulator for SITL testing

### Primary Repos

- [`open-drone-core`](https://github.com/robotics-88/open-drone-core): main point of access for ROS2 flight stack
- [`open-drone-server`](https://github.com/robotics-88/open-drone-server): provides a RESTful API on the drone
- [`open-drone-frontend`](https://github.com/robotics-88/open-drone-frontend): web app, map-based user interface

#### ROS2 Flight Stack

The 2 most critical repos are [task-manager](https://github.com/robotics-88/task-manager) and [vehicle-launch](https://github.com/robotics-88/vehicle-launch). Everything else in the stack is technically optional, but these are required for basic node and mission startup. However, to make the most use of the stack, we recommend at minimum the following:

* [task-manager](https://github.com/robotics-88/task-manager): state machine, receives and processes mission, manages flight controller params
    - *This is where you add new missions*
* [vehicle-launch](https://github.com/robotics-88/vehicle-launch): launch and vehicle config management
    - *This is where you set up new vehicle configs or change perception modules*
* [path_manager](https://github.com/robotics-88/path-manager): takes task manager mission outputs and converts those goals to executable MAVROS setpoints (can be used with or without SLAM &path planner)
    - ***This is where you get to decide how smart the drone really is, at minimum by enabling path planning, up to enabling full decision-making about what constitutes a good destination***
* [opencv_cam](https://github.com/robotics-88/opencv_cam): camera manager, starts/stops mp4 recording on arm/disarm
* [bag_recorder_2](https://github.com/robotics-88/bag_recorder_2): bag recorder, starts/stops ROS2 mcap on arm/disarm
* [image_to_v4l2loopback_ros2](https://github.com/robotics-88/image_to_v4l2loopback_ros2): makes ROS2 image topic available for RTSP streaming

Setup for additional perception capabilities such as SLAM, path planning, exploration, thermal image processing, and more are detailed in the [Setup Guide](setup/index.md).

## Development
The ROS flight stack is modular, so e.g. you can swap out your own SLAM algorithm or path planner. Additional modules can be added as well. We'd love for someone to add reactive obstacle avoidance to the path manager!
