# Development

This flight stack is intended to simplify high-level autonomy R&D. We have simple procedures for adding custom mission definitions, perception, and decision-making criteria for navigation. Each procedure is outlined in the following pages, but briefly:

- **Mission**: Active process that changes the flight behavior
- **Perception**: Passive process that can optionally be enabled during any mission
- **Decision-making Criteria**: Function to support optimal 3D navigation in complex environments
