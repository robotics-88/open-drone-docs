# Setup Guide

The flight stack can be tested with physical hardware or entirely in simulation. For hardware setup, start [here](drones/index.md). For simulation setup, start [here](simulation/index.md).

## Prerequisites
The machine where the flight stack runs, on drone or in sim on a computer, must be running Ubuntu 22.04. All dependent software including ROS2 will be installed with the setup script. To summarize, we require:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS 2 Humble
- `colcon`, `vcs`, `python3-pip`
- Git

TODO upgrade ROS version.
