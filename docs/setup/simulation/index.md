# Sim Drones

The flight stack can be tested in sim using either AirSim or Gazebo. It is highly recommended to test any new changes in sim prior to flight on a real drone! The following pages detail sim setup for each.

TODO: Add details on testing with PX4 in sim.

To begin, the first step is install [ArduPilot](ardupilot.md).

Then, the setup order depends on which environment you plan to use. If you want to test both, start with [AirSim](airsim.md) as it has preliminary setup requirements.
