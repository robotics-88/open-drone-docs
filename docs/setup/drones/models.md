# Compatible Drones

This flight stack is intended to be fully generic, able to integrate with any drone running Ubuntu and a Mavlink-based flight controller (PX4/ArduCopter agnostic). This page is a starting point for those looking for a drone or kit to purchase and setup with this software.

## Tested
* [Drone Dojo](https://dojofordrones.com/raspberry-pihawk-drone-kit/): Raspberry Pi drone, ~$900
    - Caveat: For use with LiDAR and 3D mapping, you will likely need to replace the onboard computer with a Jetson Orin Nano and design your own 3D mount. Fine as is for camera-only models.
* Robotics 88
    - TBD when this will be commercially available, we built our own model and are trying to decide what to do with it as the company is closing

## Untested 
Untested drones, but have the right hardware in theory:

* [Indro Robotics](https://indrorobotics.ca/research-drone/): R&D Drone with Jetson Xavier NX, $$?
* [Momentum Drones](https://momentumdrones.com/products/dev-7-rtf-nano-4gb?variant=41727439798353): R&D Drone with Jetson Orin NX, $7k
